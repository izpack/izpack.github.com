    <h2>Customizable</h2>
    <p>
      IzPack does not predefine a rigid installation canvas. You can freely pick the elements that you would like to
      assemble. You can choose how your installer should look like. Oh, and you can always extend it shall you
      not find the features you would be looking for!

    <h2>Cross-platform</h2>
    <p>
      The very same installer works on any operating system where a Java SE&#0153; 6+ virtual machine exists.
      IzPack-generated installers also provide optional native integration such as creating desktop shortcuts,
      manipulating a system registry or switching to an administrator account during the installation.
